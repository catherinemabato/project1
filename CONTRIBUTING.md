# Contributing guidelines

The Kubernetes node-problem-detector project accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines the process to help get your contribution accepted.

## How to become a contributor and submit your own code

### Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement
(CLA).

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an
    [individual CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
    then you'll need to sign a
    [corporate CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).

For any issues that you face during this process, please add a comment [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/27796)
explaining the issue and we will help get it sorted out.

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions on how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to
accept your pull requests.
